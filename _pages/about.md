 Hi there, my name is Yanpu, you can also call me Lesley. I'm obsessed with utilizing ML/DL techniques to discover values behind data. Now I'm working on applying ML/DL in clinical/healthcare area. Meanwhile, I really enjoy taking photos, playing pools in my spare time. I'm a big fan for both cats and O'Sullivan. This blog is mainly for sharing my ideas and notes in machine learning, NLP and reinforcement learning. All comments and correctness are highly appreciated :)
