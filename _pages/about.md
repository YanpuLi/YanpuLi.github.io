 Hi there, I'm a data science student graduated from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). My advisor is Prof. Elke A. Rundensteiner. Before that, I have already got my Computer Science Bachelor's and Master's degree in China. I have broad research interests in machine learning, NLP and deep learning.
