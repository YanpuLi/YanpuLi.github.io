 Hi there, my name is Yanpu, you can also call me Lesley. I'm obsessed with utilizing ML/DL techniques to discover values behind data, especially for healthcare area. My interests lie in designing robust learning methods to precisely identify diseases, developing unsupervised frameworks for thorough medical data extraction which requires less manual annotation. I also have a broad interest in adversarial machine learning, representation learning and reinforcement learning. 

 Meanwhile, I really enjoy taking photos, playing pools in my spare time. I'm a big fan for both cats and O'Sullivan. This blog is mainly for sharing my ideas and notes of data analytics. All comments and correctness are highly appreciated :)
