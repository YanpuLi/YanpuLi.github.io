Hi there, I'm a data science student graduated from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). My advisor is Prof. Elke A. Rundensteiner. Before that, I have already got my Computer Science Bachelor's and Master's degree in China. I have broad research interests in machine learning, NLP and deep learning. 

Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science, Henan University, 2011
* M.S. in Computer Science, Jilin University, 2014
* M.S. in Data Science, WPI, 2016 

Research Experience
======
* Main Contributor, Role of plant MicroRNA in cross-species regulatory networks of humans, 01/2012- 07/2014           
  Biological Identification and Information Security Laboratory
  * Aimed to explore the potential effects of ingeste plants microRNA on human digestive organs                             
  * Designed the main workflow, preprocessed nearly 400,000 pieces of structured and unstructured gene targets, designed a feature extraction based on alignment types
  * Generated a weighted regulatory network with 782 genes and 2444 interactions, conducted module extraction based on hub node and functional enrichment analysis
  * Assigned two undergraduate students as assistants and was given one-on-one instruction by the chair of computer science department at Missouri University

Work experience
======
* Data Analyst Intern, CloudParticle, CA, 08/2016                                                             
  * Participated in a wide range of data analysis projects, including vehicle rental reservation, credit card authorization recycling prediction, Google Adwords campaign automatic monitor
  * Responsible for build pipeline to do data preprocess, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation

* Data Engineer Intern, Pfizer, CT, 05/2016
  * Enabled automatic process for Hadoop ingestion of data from multiple sources, created scripts to parse multi-formats data into json and parquet format
  * Connected MapR with Spotfire/ Tableau, used Apache Drill to create both json and parquet view to generate overlay visualizations  

* Data Analyst Intern, Zakipoint Health Inc, MA, 12/2015
  * Developed a web-based simulation and analysis tool with Django framework to preprocess raw Pharmacy claim data, find potential cost driver under various scenarios, and display results by D3.js
  * Designed the data model, manipulated data storing and querying in mongoDB integrated with PyMongo 
  
Projects
======
* Vehicle Rental Reservation Strategy Recommendation, CouldParticle, 04/2017
  * Utilized vehicle rental transaction data to predict which vehicle features are the most important ones 
  * Built pipeline to do data preprocess, feature engineering. Generated weighted response, used oversampling method to balance dataset; Conducted multiple models such, ensemble them to obtain the best performance

* Spatial Data Analysis: Exploration of MBTA Late Night Service with Crime Dataset, WPI, 05/2016
  * Utilized public APIs to gather around 400,000+ crime data, 4000+ Restaurants data and 240,000+ ridership transaction records, combined three datasets to analyze the influence of MBTA Late Night Service on crime rate around Boston area
  * Converted crime data UTM zone coordinates, implemented DBSCAN and K-means to find the distribution pattern; Applied spatial join on crime, MBTA and restaurant datasets, used PCA for dimension reduction, conducted various classification methods to predict the relationship between ridership frequency and crime rate

* National Data Mining Competition: Bank Customer Satisfaction Degree Prediction, Rang Tech, 06/2016
  * Predicted if customers are satisfied with their banking experience 
  * Conducted preprocessing steps by replacing NA, dropping outliers, applied feature scaling methods, generated new features based on univariate and bivariate analysis, generated a 2-layer 5-fold stacking model
