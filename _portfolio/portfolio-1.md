"New York City (NYC) is the most populous city in the US and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. As a metropolitan city, the public transportation plays a very important role for the convenience of the city's dwellers and visitors. The subway is considered as the favorite public transportation. However, during summer time where most people would visit the city, there has been a major issue occurred frequently over years, which is the hot cars problem. The hot car problem is caused by the air-conditioning breakdowns in the subway cars which happened about 10 times a day during June, July and August between 2010 and 2014, according to analysis of Metropolitan Transportation Authority data obtained by The New York World through open records request. 

In total, there were nearly 6,500 “hot cars” over the five-year period covered by the data. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of those incidents occurred during the hottest months of the year. This problem brings a very bad experience for the users, as they described that it was a horrendous to be stuck on an underground hot train.
