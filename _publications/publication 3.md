excerpt: '**Goal:** infectious disease(flu, HFRS, mumps etc.) morbidity rate prediction. **More specific:** compared to traditional infeactious disease prediction which mainly focus on historical morbidity incidences, our research uses multimodal deep learning, combining info from morbidity history, weather, air quality and search engine/ social network.
