collection: publications
permalink: /publications/publication 1
venue: "BMC Systems Biology"
excerpt: '**Background:** virus RNA has impact on human RNA **Goal:** reverse the angle: explore human microRNA's impact on viral gene expression, which is an antiviral defense mechanism. **More specific:** computational prediction of the influence of human microRNA on virus RNA expression. **Role:** one-year research, working as research assistant'
