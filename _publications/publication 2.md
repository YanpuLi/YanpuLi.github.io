title: Role of plant MicroRNA in cross-species regulatory networks of humans
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/publication 2
venue: "BMC Systems Biology"
excerpt: '**Background:** plant microRNAs have been found still active after digestion. **Goal:** exploratory research about whether exogenous miRNA derived from vegetables will have impact on human in RNA interaction level. **More specific:** computational prediction of the influence of plant microRNA on human RNA expression level in different organs(stomach, kidney, liver etc). **Future Exploration:** may aim at exploring the influence of GMO(genetically modified organisms) food on human.**Role:** three-year research, working as the major contributor.'
