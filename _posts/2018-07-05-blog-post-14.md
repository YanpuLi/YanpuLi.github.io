## RNN

Finally, I'm writing something about neural network. I will start with the branch which I'm most familiar with, the sequential NN, which is widely used in NLP and time series problems(due to its structure characteristics). In this post, I won't talk about the forward/ backword propogation, as there are plenty of excellent blogs and online courses already have done that. My point is to give clear comparison between RNN, LSTM and GRU.
