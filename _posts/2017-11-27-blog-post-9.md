## Introduction
Recently, I have read some papers about Reinforcement Learning (RL). To me, it's quite an interesting topic. So I wrote this post to make summaries. RL is about through interacting with the environment sequentially, the agent will gradually learn how to take actions to maximize an accumulative reward. It acts just like a human being, good behavior results in reward, bad one leads to punishment. This concept is easy to understand. But before illustrating the core elements of RL, I'd like to stop here and ask a few questions. We've already got a lot of super powerful "learning", like machine learning, sub-areas: supervised learning, unsupervised learning. What's the relationship between RL and these existing ones? Why RL is still necessary? RL is also a sub-area in machine learning. You can see the difference in the table below.
 
|      | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning    |         RL                     |
|----- |-------------------       | --------------------------| --------------------------------------- |
|Input | labeled data             | unlabeled data            | initial state           |
|Working Process| train on training set, look for model to optimize certain object function   | look for model to gain insights into data                 | learn from environment in **a sequential process**, take actions, either being punished or rewarded, aiming to maximize reward,             |
|Validation    | validate on testing set |             | evaluate by reward function                    |
|Application  | regression, classification| clustering, segmentation, association| prediction, control|

## Core Elements
A RL system contains 6 core elements: agent, environment, policy, reward signal, value function and model of the environment. In my opinion, the agent and environment is kind like entity, and the rest four elements are like attributes belong to entity.
