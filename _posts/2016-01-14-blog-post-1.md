Introduction of Stacking
======
Stacking, stacked generalization, is a combination of base classifiers (generally different learning algorithms) and meta learner, which is used to train on the output of the first layer. To maintain the performance of a stacking model, it requires to ensure each classifiers are diverse and accurate
