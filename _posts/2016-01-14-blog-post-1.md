Introduction of Stacking
======
Stacking, stacked generalization, is composed of two types of layers: 
1. base classifiers (generally different learning algorithms)
2. meta learner (tries to combine the output of the first layer to obtain the final results)

To maintain the performance of a stacking model, it requires diversity and accuracy among each classifiers. Because by applying similar models, it is highly possible that they would make wrong decisions at the same instance. However, if the classifiers are diverse, their errors will not be highly correlated, and the combination of classifer will perform better than the base classifiers.

Before explaining stacking algorithm in details, I'd like to make a horizontal comparison of stacking against bagging and boosting. As these three algorithms all belong to ensemble learning, which is to combine a set of classifiers together with their outputs such that the result outperforms all the individual classifiers. Here, I have listed the differences in the table below. 

### Table 1

| Method       | Goal             |  Data Partition                                        | Classifiers                            | Combination of base models|
| ---------    | ---------------  | ---------------------------------------                | ----------------------------           | ------------|
| [Bagging](#) | decrease variance| sampling with replacement                              | same type & parallel ensemble           | average|    
| [Boosting](#)| decrease bias    | emphasize training instances, previously mis-classified| same type & sequential ensemble         | weighted majority vote |
| [Stacking](#)| both             | CV (generally LOOCV)                                   | diverse types & two layers (base, meta) | meta learner|

Aren't headings cool?
