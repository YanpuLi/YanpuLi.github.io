This post is about introducing.....

Language is very powerful, as it can contain huge amount of information behind the words.
Language is free both in length and pattern, with a subtle change in words, the meaning of that sentence may change much. Let me take a subset from a diagnosis summary as example:

`he had diabetes problems`      `Patient A denied that he had diabetes problems`
With the negative word(deny), the meaning of that sentence becomes totally different. More often, this negative word may comes in before, after, in other negative forms(no, -), or even sentences far away from its corresponding main sentence. And it's such property makes language hard to be understood by machines. Because they only work on fixed format numeric values.
