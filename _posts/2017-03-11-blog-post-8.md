## Advantage of Density-based Clustering over Partitioning and Hierarchical Methods
### Disadvantage of Partitioning and Hierarchical Methods
Partitioning algorithm, such as k-means, it requires to <ins>*declare k*</ins> in the first step of clustering. Moreover, it has <ins>*restrictions on the shape of clusters (convex shape)*</ins>, meaning it requires gaussian shape clusters.

**Convex set:** An object is convex if for every pair of points inside the object, every point on the straight line segment is also within the object.

Figure 1. Convex Set and Non-convex Set

Example of K-means working on non-convex data: I have faked a banana shape dataset, and used kmeans with 2 clusters and 3 clusters to group the data, shown in the Fig. 2.

Figure 2. Kmeans with Non-convex Data
Hierarchical algorithm: it is <ins>*hard to define termination conditions*</ins>. For example, it is difficult to determine the value of D<sub>min</sub>, which is small enough to seperate all clusters and large enough such that no clusters are being split. 

Compared to these 2 algorithms, DBSCAN (a density-based method) only has *a minimal requirement of input, allows arbitrary cluster shape, and works efficiently on large dataset*.
