Tree is one of the most widely used model, with a large family(regression tree, classification tree, bagging: RF, boosting: GBDT), and implementations(ID3, C4.5, CART). This series of posts will start from a brief introduction of the basic principles of DT, RF and GBDT, then dive deeper into this family by making comparisons.
