when building a recommendation system, it mainly deals with problems, such as: How to collect data (known ratings) in the utility matrix; How to estimate unknown ratings from the known; Evaluating approach 

**About the dataset:** There are two types of entities, users and items. A utility matrix is used for storing each user-item pair, and it is usually a sparse matrix. This is because most people haven't rated most items, new items have no ratings, or new users have no history information.  
Based on these features, there are mainly 2 groups of architechtures to build a recommendation system: content-based and collaborative filtering. In this post, I mainly focus on talking about these two approaches. 

##Content-based
  * Main idea: focus on item properties, recommend items to customer x, which is similar to previous items rated highly by x
  * Example: recommend movies with same actors

###Item Profiles
In content-based system, an item profile must be created for each item, recording important properties of that item.

##Collaborative filtering
  * Main idea: focus on the relationship between users and items
