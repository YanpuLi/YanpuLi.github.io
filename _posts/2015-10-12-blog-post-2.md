When building a recommendation system, it mainly deals with problems, such as: How to collect data (known ratings) in the utility matrix; How to estimate unknown ratings from the known; Evaluating approach 

Dataset
======
There are two types of entities, users and items. A utility matrix is used for storing each user-item pair, and it is usually a sparse matrix. This is because most people haven't rated most items, new items have no ratings, or new users have no history information.  
Based on these features, there are mainly 2 groups of architechtures to build a recommendation system: content-based and collaborative filtering. In this post, I mainly focus on talking about these two approaches. 

Content-based
======
  * Main idea: focus on item properties, recommend items to customer x, which is similar to previous items rated highly by x
  * Example: recommend movies with same actors

**Item Profile**
In content-based system, an item profile must be created for each item, recording important properties of that item. For text content, we can use TF-IDF to calculate scores for the document to create doc profile, and pick the words with highest scores as important features. w<sub>j</sub> = (w<sub>1j</sub>,...,w<sub>ij</sub>,...,w<sub>kj</sub>)

For images, one way is to let the users making tags for each pictures. However, users may not be willing to do this, as it is very troublesome.

**User Profile**
It is used for describing the users' preferences. It can be created into 2 ways. 
* weighted average of rated item profiles
* variations: weight by difference from average rating for item. Given user profile w<sub>x</sub>, item profile w<sub>j</sub>:       
r<sub>xj</sub> = cos(w<sub>x</sub>, w<sub>j</sub>) = w<sub>x</sub>w<sub>j</sub> / ||w<sub>x</sub>||.||w<sub>j</sub>||

**Pros & Cons for Content-base System**

| Pros                                | Cons   |                                                              
| --------                            | ------ | 
| no need for data on other users     | hard to choose proper features   |                       
| able to recommend to users with unique tastes    | hard to create user profile for new users   |                         
| able to recommend new unpopular items     | never recommends items beyond user's content profile   |                         
| can provide explanations (item features)   | unable to exploit quality judgements of other users   |                         

Collaborative filtering
======
  * Main idea: focus on harnessing quality judgements of other users, it includes 2 process, finding users having similar tastes, and recommending what the similar users like.

**Find Similar Users:** r<sub>x</sub>: the vector of user x's ratings
* Jaccard distance: ignore ratings, only focus on which items have been rated, 
* Cosine distance: problem: it will tread missing ratings as negative. 
Sim(x,y) = cos(r<sub>x</sub>, r<sub>y</sub>) = r<sub>x</sub>r<sub>y</sub>||r<sub>x</sub>||.||r<sub>y</sub>||
* Pearson correlation coefficient:

Sim(x,y) = cos(r<sub>x</sub>, r<sub>y</sub>) 
         = (r<sub>x</sub>-r<sub>x,avg</sub>)(r<sub>y</sub>-r<sub>y,avg</sub>)||r<sub>x</sub>-r<sub>x,avg</sub>||.||r<sub>y</sub>-r<sub>y,avg</sub>||

Headings are cool

You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
