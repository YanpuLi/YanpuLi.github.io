when building a recommendation system, it mainly deals with problems, such as:
* How to collect data (known ratings) in the utility matrix
* How to estimate unknown ratings from the known
* Evaluating approach 

**About the dataset:** There are two types of entities, users and items. A utility matrix is used for storing each user-item pair, and it is usually a sparse matrix. This is because most people haven't rated most items, new items have no ratings, or new users have no history information.  
Based on these features, there are mainly 2 groups of approaches to build a recommendation system: content-based and collaborative filtering. In this post, I mainly focus on talking about these two approaches. 
* Content-based
* Collaborative filtering
