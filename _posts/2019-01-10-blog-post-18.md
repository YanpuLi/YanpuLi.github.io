For the past 4 months, I have been working on cardiovascular disease risk prediction. Through this, I come up with an idea to utilize GAN to learn in a progressive way and decide to write a paper on this topic(Sry, I can't talk much about my idea in details.). Then, I began doing background research and found three related topic. In this post, I will give summarizations of these topic. 

From my point of view, stacked(or say progressive) GAN is kind of a new topic, related paper has been published starting from 2016 ( plz feel free to leave msg, if you know other related paper which is earlier than 2016, or you know other related interesting topics). 

**Table 1.**
| Paper(Topic)        | Publication Year           | Goal  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Stacked GAN      | 2017 | generate high-quality image |
| StackGAN++      | 2018      |  generate high-resolution photo image  |
| PA-GAN | 2019      |  stablize training process   |
