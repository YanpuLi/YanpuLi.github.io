### Why PI ?
In human learning, we have teachers, who master the knowledge well. Thus, being taught by the teachers, we students can quickly get to the point of that question, filter out false ones, learn very fast, and achieve good marks in the test by ourselves. That's why PI is introduced, to help ML models learning in a more fast and accurate way on training set, and work well indepedently on testing set.

This topic was first introduced by Vladimir Vapnik and Akshay Vashist in 2009, and updated a new mechanism to PI in 2015. In this post, I will talk about the main mechanisms used in PI.
